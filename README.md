# Overview

You and your team have ultimately decided that a microservice architecture is the architectural choice of the future for the microblogging platform.  To begin your foray into microservices, you decide that the proper route forward is to take a single piece of functionality and break it out into its own service. You think a good place to start is a feature that you've spent some time working on already during this course: the image service for handling user profile photos and images attached to their posts on the platform.

After you and your team build the image service and integrate it with the rest of the application, you suddenly realize: wait, what's going to happen when the image service is offline?  Will the whole application be broken?

You decide you need to do some resilience testing.

## Part 1: Testing

Students should start by first examining the code that is used to communicate between the microblog and the image service and determine what they first *believe* will happen when the image service is down.  Then, students should test this through either automated and manual testing to verify their assumptions.

## Part 2: Adaptation

The project manager for the image service decides that the failure of the image service should not bring the entire site down.  Therefore, they want the system to implement some sort of fallback behavior where, if the image from the image service is unavailable, it will default to using the Gravatar image instead.  

Students should adapt the code to implement this behavior and verify this through testing.

# Installation Instructions

## Prerequisites 

_Provided are instructions for Mac OS X and Linux; if you're on Windows, we recommend you use the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) and follow the Linux instructions._

1. If you don't have Python 3 installed already, follow the instructions below.  On all OS's, you can see if you have Python 3 installed by running `python3 --version`.  If you have Python 3 installed, you can skip to the next step.

* If you are using Linux or WSL in Windows, use the following [instructions](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-python-3-and-set-up-a-programming-environment-on-an-ubuntu-20-04-server).  
* If you are on Mac OS X, first make sure you have [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) installed.  Next, install the Xcode command-line tools using the following command `xcode-select --install`.  Then, use the following [instructions](https://opensource.com/article/19/5/python-3-default-mac) on making Python 3 the default Python environment.

2. Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).

## Microblog

_All starter code for all of the assignments is available through Gradescope._

1. Create and activate a virtual environment for Python.  This should be run in your terminal.

```sh
python3 -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate
```

2. Install the required Python dependencies.

```sh
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Setup the database for the Flask service.

```sh
flask db upgrade && flask translate compile
```

4. Run the flask application.

```sh
python3 -m flask run
```

5. Verify you can access the application using your web browser by navigating to the microblog at: [http://127.0.0.1:5000/](http://127.0.0.1:5000/).
